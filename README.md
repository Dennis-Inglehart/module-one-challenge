# Horiseon Webpage

## The webpage for Horiseon

An elegant and straightforward webpage design for Horiseon, with a prominent banner image featuring links to their sub-pages, and below that, panels describing the services Horiseon provides and the benefits of working with Horiseon.

Since no sub-pages currently exist, the links lead to Wikipedia articles on historical White House pets.

The page was recently updated to increase its accessibility to the visually impaired.
